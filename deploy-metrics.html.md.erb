<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The JMX Bridge tool is a JMX extension for Elastic Runtime.
Follow the instructions below to deploy JMX Bridge using the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-metrics) (PCF) Operations Manager.

## <a id='import'></a>Step 1: Install the JMX Bridge Tile ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To use the Firehose Nozzle, you <strong>must</strong> install <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime">Elastic Runtime</a> before installing JMX Bridge. 
Starting in 1.8.7, the JMX Bridge product enforces this install order dependency. </p>

1. [Download JMX Bridge](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-metrics).

1. Import JMX Bridge into Ops Manager by following the instructions for [Adding and Importing Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/customizing/add-delete.html#add-import).

1. On the Installation Dashboard, click the **JMX Bridge** tile.

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/tile.png") %>

    The orange bar on the **JMX Bridge** tile indicates that the
    product requires configuration.

## <a id='config-az'></a>Step 2: Assign Availability Zones and Networks

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**. This section shows the Availability Zones that you [create](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/customizing/vsphere-config.html#create-az) when configuring Ops Manager Director.

1. (**vSphere and Amazon Web Services Only**) Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs in**. Ops Manager runs Metrics jobs with a single instance in this Availability Zone.

1. (**vSphere and Amazon Web Services Only**) Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs in**. Ops Manager balances instances of Metrics jobs with more than one instance across the Availability Zones that you specify.

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/assign-az.png") %>

1. Select a Network from the drop down menu.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: JMX Bridge uses the default Assigned Network if you do not select a different network.</p>

1. Click **Save**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you save this form, the following verification error displays because
  the PCF security group blocks ICMP. You can ignore this error.</p>
    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/er-network-error.png") %>

## <a id='config-jmx-provider'></a>Step 3: Configure JMX Provider ##

1. Select **JMX Provider**.

1. Enter a new username and password into the **JMX Provider credentials** username and password fields.

1. Record these credentials. You use these to connect JMX clients to the JMX Provider.

## <a id='config-nat'></a>(Optional) Step 4: Disable or Enable NAT Support ##

1. Select the **Enable** radio button.
NAT support is disabled by default. This option allows you to set the NAT IP as the host IP. 
By default, the internal IP address of the JMX Provider VM is set as the host IP.

1. Enter the NAT IP as the External IP address in the form `0.0.0.0`

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/enable-nat-support.png") %>
    
1. If you have enabled or disabled `NAT Support`, click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To connect to the JMX Provider after install, you <strong>must</strong> use the specified
IP address. The IP address displayed in the <code>Status</code> tab always reflects the internal IP address of the JMX Provider VM, not the external IP address.</p>

## <a id='config-prefix'></a>(Optional) Step 5: Disable or Enable the Nozzle Prefix ##
By default, the Nozzle prefix `opentsdb.nozzle` prepends to Firehose-transmitted metrics, in order to maintain backward compatibility with prior versions of JMX Bridge.

1. If you do not require backward compatibility, you can make the metrics more readable by clearing the **Enable Nozzle Prefix** checkbox. This omits the `opentsdb.nozzle` prefix.

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/enable-prefix.png") %>

1. If you have enabled or disabled `Enable Nozzle Prefix`, click **Save**.
Note that enabling or disabling this feature will cause temporary overlap of metrics coming through in both naming
formats. Metrics with the former metric name format will continue to appear in the MBean tree until the JMX Provider is restarted
or the MBean store needs additional space to store new metrics.


## <a id='config-security-logging'></a>(Optional) Step 6: Disable or Enable Security Logging ##

1. Select the **Enable Security Logging** checkbox.
Access to the JMX endpoint is logged to STDOUT by default. 
You can enable this security logging in the JMX Bridge tile configuration by selecting
this checkbox, or disable it deselecting this checkbox. Security logging is enabled by default.

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/enable-security-logging.png") %>
    
1. If you have enabled or disabled `Security Logging`, click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Related log output is made available by
initiating a JMX Provider logs download from the JMX Bridge tile configuration status tab,
then  fetching the download from the logs tab.</p>

## <a id='config-ssl'></a>(Optional) Step 7: Configure SSL ##

1. Select the **Enable SSL** checkbox.
Enabling SSL requires JMX clients to use SSL to connect to the JMX Provider.
If SSL is not enabled, JMX clients can connect to the JMX Provider without SSL
credentials.

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/enable-jmx-ssl.png") %>

    If you select the **Enable SSL** checkbox, you must also provide an SSL
	certificate and private key.
    There are two ways to provide an SSL certificate and private key:
    * If you are using a signed certificate, paste an X.509 certificate in the
    **Certificate PEM** field and a PKCS#1 private key in the **Private Key**
    field.
    * If you want to use SSL but do not want to use a signed certificate, you
    must perform the following actions:
        1. Generate a self-signed certificate on the server.
        1. Import the self-signed certificate to a trust store on the client.
        1. Start jConsole, or another monitoring tool, with the trust store.

        For more information, see [Using SSL with a Self-Signed Certificate](./self-signed-ssl.html).

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/external-ssl-cert.png") %>

1. After providing an SSL certificate and private key, click **Save**.

## <a id='errands'></a>(Optional) Step 8: Configure Errands ##

<p>Errands are scripts that Ops Manager runs to automate tasks. 
By default, Ops Manager runs the post-install errands listed below when you deploy PCF JMX Bridge.
However, you can prevent a specific post-install errand from running by deselecting its checkbox on the Errands page.</p>

  <%= image_tag("images/deploying/errands.png") %>
    
* Select **Smoke tests for JMX Bridge** to cause the JMX Bridge to verify the following: 
  * If the Firehose Nozzle is enabled, that the Nozzle is receiving metrics
  * If the Firehose Nozzle is enabled, that the product is not a slow consumer
  * If <a href="#config-ip">BOSH Metrics</a> are enabled, that the product is receiving appropriate health metrics

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If errors occur during the install due to smoke tests, refer to
the <a href="./troubleshooting-uninstall-metrics.html#smoke-tests">troubleshooting documentation</a> for more information.</p>

## <a id='resource-config'></a>(Optional) Step 9: Resource Configuration ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In JMX Bridge 1.8.7, the Firehose Nozzle is enabled by default and
requires <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime">Elastic Runtime</a> as a dependency.</p>

To disable the Firehose Nozzle or stop receiving <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime">Elastic Runtime</a>
 (including Diego) metrics, modify the instance count of the **Firehose Nozzle** from `1` to `0`.

## <a id='apply'></a>Step 10: Apply Changes ##

1. Navigate to the PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. In the Pending Changes view, click **Apply Changes** to install JMX Bridge.

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/pending-changes.png") %>

After installation completes, a message appears stating that the changes have been applied.

## <a id='get-ip'></a>Step 11: Find the IP Address of the JMX Provider ##

1. Click **Return to Product Dashboard**.

1. Click the **JMX Bridge** tile and select the **Status** tab.

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/jmx-provider-ip.png") %>

1. Record the IP address of the **JMX Provider**.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After installation, your JMX client connects to this IP address at port 44444
using the credentials that you  supplied. Also ensure that TCP port 44445 is open.</p>

## <a id='config-ip'></a>Step 12: Configure the JMX Provider IP Address ##

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.
Click the **Ops Manager Director** tile and select **Director Config**.

    <%= image_tag("images/deploying/ops-manager-director-ip.png") %>

1. In the **JMX Provider IP Address** field, enter the IP address of the JMX
Provider.
Click **Save**.

## <a id='complete'></a>Step 13: Complete Installation ##
