The Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) JMX Bridge collects and exposes system data from Cloud Foundry components via a JMX endpoint. You can use this system data to monitor your installation and assist in troubleshooting.

The JMX Bridge tool is composed of the following three virtual machines:

- The JMX provider
- A VM that governs compilation
- A nozzle for the [Loggregator Firehose](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/loggregator/architecture.html)
