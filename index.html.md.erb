The Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) JMX Bridge collects and exposes system data from Cloud Foundry components via a JMX endpoint.
You can use this system data to monitor your installation and assist in troubleshooting.

The JMX Bridge tool is composed of the following two virtual machines:

- The JMX provider
- A Nozzle for the [Loggregator Firehose](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/loggregator/architecture.html)
  - For more information on how a Firehose nozzle works, reference the Loggregator [docs](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/architecture.html#nozzles)
